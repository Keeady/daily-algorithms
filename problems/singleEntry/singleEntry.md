Given a `non-empty` array of integers, every element appears twice except one. Find that single one.

NOTE: 
Your algorithm shoul dhave a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 

EXAMPLE 1: 

```

Input: [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1

```

EXAMPLE 2: 	


```
Input: [4,1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4
